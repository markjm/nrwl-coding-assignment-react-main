# Coding Assesment

By request, I have intentionally not spent more than 2 hours on this so that you can get an accurate depiction of my skills in this area. As a caveat, my specialty is related to build tools and systems, and less in the actual front-end standing up pretty websites. In my past roles, however, I have actively supported our react developers, which (hopefully) allowed the core concepts to rub off on me. To complete this assignment, I created some simple react hooks to grab the data from the backend provide a very basic display of that data. Due to the time constraints, the demo is missing a lot of error handling and edge cases - but I have gone through and added some comments of what should be done, given a production-ify-ing of this demo.
